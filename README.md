Biometric authentication is an advanced security process that verifies an individual's identity by analyzing unique biological traits, such as fingerprints, voice patterns, and retinal scans. 

This innovative approach offers a more secure and convenient alternative to traditional authentication methods, such as passwords and PINs, which can be easily forgotten or compromised.

The goal of this project is to develop a sophisticated Siamese network model tailored for biometric authentication, with a particular emphasis on fingerprint recognition. 

This model will leverage deep learning techniques to accurately compare and verify fingerprints, enhancing both the reliability and speed of the authentication process. 

By utilizing the distinctive features of fingerprints, the system aims to provide a robust solution for secure access to devices and systems, thereby improving user experience and security.
