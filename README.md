Biometric authentication is a security
process that verifies the identity of a user,
who is trying to access a device or system,
through his/her unique biological
characteristics; such as fingerprints,
voice, and retina. It offers a secure and
convenient alternative to passwords and
other traditional authentication methods.

This Project aims to build a Siamese network model that can
be used to perform biometric authentication especially fingerprint
